In this assignment, I considered the 'mushroom' data set:
https://tinyurl.com/UTSC-Mushroom.  

This data set consists of 8124 data points concerning 23 species of mushroom.  I built a decision tree to classify these data into 'poisonous' and 'edible'.
The script:
1.	Randomly splits the data into training and testing data sets, 80% and 20% respectively.
2.	Creates a decision tree for the training data, with the data's 'class' column acting as the dependent variable.
a.	 ‘rpart’ set to create a tree with 3 splits
3.	Prints out the 3 most important features which are used in determining the tree splits.
4.	Print out the confusion matrix for the test data.
5.	Creates a plot of the decision tree.
