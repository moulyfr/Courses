    Added figure size and point size to pdf function, and cex, font, main inputs for raprt.plot, for question 1e. Also added cat lines explaining what is being printed to Mushroom.R: before print(Data.tree$frame$var), before confusion matrix, and before rpart. Also added cat lines to Seeds.R before print(varImp(knnFit)), print optimal k value, and before confusion matrix, explaining what is being printed.
